# Operators and Loops


## Loops:
Loops check condition, if it returns a true, then code  will run, then after its done if its still true,then it runs it again

* For loop: if you use it, it will run the code a specific number of times.
* While: you use it when you dont know how many times you need the code to run
* Do While; its similiar to while except it will run every code that it has inside the curly brackets.

### For loop uses counter as condition


#### The for loop has the following syntax:

for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
// code block to be executed }

#### The While Loop
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

Syntax
while (condition) {
// code block to be executed
}


## comparisation signs :

1. == called equal to in data
1. != called not equal to in data
1. === called equal to in type and data
1. !== called not equal in type and type

## logical operaters
* && called and logic
* ”	 	” called or logic
